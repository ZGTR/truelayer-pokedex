Hi Nicolas,

Thank you very much for your reply.

1. Yes, you can reply to us by the end of this week.
2. We expect you to take 1 week holidays during Christmas holidays, namely between 20/12 and 03/01 or thereabout. Regarding another week: we are happy to accept remote working if you wish. Mohammad & you will agree on how this can be done.

We are excited to release the new version of the App that will be the core for all the next innovative features that we plan to build, implementing the advantages of social communities & habit forming techniques to rehabilitation. We believe that if joined us, your contribution to this ambition will be significant.

We look forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Dimitris and Mohammad
